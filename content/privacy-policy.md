# Privacy Policy

Effective Date: 2025/04/06

## Introduction

Welcome to Smart Cooking Â©!

Your privacy is important to us.
This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your personal data when you visit our website.

## Information We Collect

We collect and process the following types of information:

### User Accounts & Authentication

Users can create accounts directly on our platform, as we handle authentication internally without relying on third-party providers.

### Login & Session Data

We use cookies to store authentication tokens and session data to keep you logged in securely.

### IP Address Logging

We log full IP addresses to apply rate limiting and prevent DoS attacks. This data is used solely for security purposes and is not linked to any personal user information. These logs are retained for **90 days** before being permanently deleted.

## How We Use Your Information

We use your information to:

- Provide secure login and authentication services.
- Prevent abuse, such as DoS attacks, through rate limiting.

## Cookies and Tracking Technologies

We use **essential cookies** to maintain user sessions and authentication. These cookies do not track your behavior outside our website. By using our site, you consent to our use of these cookies. You can manage cookies in your browser settings.

Additionally, we use a cookie to store your **preferred language** setting. However, this may be removed in the future. At this time, there is no mechanism to opt out of cookies beyond browser settings.

## Data Sharing & Security

- We **do not** sell, trade, or rent your personal information to third parties.
- We **do not** log or store any user activity data beyond session management and full IP logging for security purposes.
- We implement security measures to protect your data from unauthorized access.

## Example Data Storage Formats

For transparency, below are examples of how data is logged and stored in our system:

### Cookies and Tracking Technologies

We use session cookies to store authentication-related data such as session tokens and refresh tokens. These cookies are essential for keeping you securely logged in and expire after a set period.

We use HttpOnly and Secure cookies to store authentication tokens. This prevents unauthorized access via JavaScript and ensures that sensitive data is only transmitted over encrypted connections.

### Log Data Format

These are logs of user activity within our system, such as authentication and website access:

```
2025-04-02 14:21:50 - config.logging - INFO - 172.17.0.1: GET / 200
2025-04-02 14:21:54 - config.logging - INFO - 172.17.0.1: POST /auth/login 200
```

### User Data Storage

Below is an example of how user data might be stored when you create an account on our platform:

- **User ID**: 6
- **Name**: Jane Doe
- **Email**: (Stored securely, not viewable by anyone, even our team)
- **Password**: (Hashed and encrypted using modern algorithms for your protection)
- **Registration Date**: April 1st, 2025 at 00:00
- **Last Login**: Not yet logged in
- **Preferred Language**: English

### Data Protection Explanation

We ensure that your information is safe, even in the event of a database breach.

- **Password Hashing**: Your password is transformed into a non-reversible hash, which means that even we cannot view your actual password.
- **Email Encryption**: Your email is encrypted to protect it from unauthorized access.

## Transparency & User Control

- Our website code is **fully open-source and available on GitHub**, allowing users to verify how data is handled.
- You have the right to access and understand how your data is used.
- Users may request data deletion by opening an issue on our GitHub repository (if they have a GitHub account) or by contacting us.
